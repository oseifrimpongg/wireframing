# Wireframing

## Introduction

Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide that represents the structure and layout of a digital interface. It focuses on functionality, user flow, and content placement rather than visual design details.

## Importance in the Design Process

Wireframing plays a critical role in UI/UX design as it:

- Clarifies product requirements before development begins.
- Helps identify usability issues early.
- Improves communication between designers, developers, and stakeholders.
- Reduces time and cost by avoiding major revisions later.
- Serves as a blueprint for building user-friendly and functional interfaces.
